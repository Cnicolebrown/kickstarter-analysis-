Theater Analysis 

Overview: The primary purpose of this analysis was to determine a relationship between Kickstarter success and different confounding factors. Elements such as original launch date and funding goal were examined and visualized to determine their impact on the outcome of the campaign. 
Analysis and Challenges: To conduct the analysis the data was stored in excel and filtered. To assist with the analysis of outcomes by dates, a pivot table was created to help with development of a line graph. To analyze success by funding goals, the count IFS formula was utilized to count the number of outcomes based on different filtering features. This area was a little difficult due to having to use some nested formulas. It was important to ensure that the right columns and names were called upon when writing the formulas. It was also important to ensure that the right values were typed out when writing the formulas as well, incorrect input of this would have resulted in incorrect graphical representation. Once the formulas were written out and the information was saved, the sum function was used to help in the calculation of percentages for the outcomes. 

Results: 
Deliverable 1
From the graph, projects that started in May had a higher change of success versus those started in January. However, May is the peak of the successful campaigns, after that the success rate does begin to steadily decline, so it would be best to begin the campaigns before May to ensure success. October had the highest rate of failed campaigns so it would be best to avoid starting a campaign in October. There was not a correlation between Cancelled campaigns and the launch date, this trend remained low and consistent according to the data. 

Deliverable 2
There appears to be an inverse relationship between the goal and the percentage of success. As the funding goal increased the percent of success decreased and the percent failed increased. The highest chance of successful funding being reached occurs between the 30000 and 45000. 

Limitations:
One of the limitations of this data set was the limitations of pledged values. This could cause some outliers, due to someone pledging a high amount of funding to a project but never following through with this information. It would be useful to know if the donation was fulfilled, partially fulfilled, not at all. 

Additional Visualizations: 
Additional visualizations examining if there was a relationship between funding success and the type of play would be interesting to explore. This would allow us to determine if one type of play has a higher chance of success and chance of meeting their funding goal. It would also be interesting to explore the relationship between the end date and the success of the goal. Another feature worth examining is the year in which the Kickstarter took place and the relationship between outcomes. Finally, an examination of country and the success rate of Kickstarter projects would be interesting to look at as well.
